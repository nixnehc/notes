\section{The Class \textsf{P}} 

A \textit{complexity class}is a set of functions that can be computed within given resource bounds.





\begin{df}[The class \textsf{DTIME}]
    The class \textsf{DTIME}($f(n)$) is the set of all functions that can be computed by a deterministic Turing machine in $O(f(n))$ steps.
\end{df}

The \textsf{D} in the notation \textsf{DTIME} refers to ``deterministic''.



\begin{df}[The class \textsf{P}]
    The class \textsf{P} is the union of all complexity classes \textbf{DTIME}($n^c$) for all  $c$.
    % 
    In other words,
    \[
        \mathsf{P} = \bigcup_{c \geq 1} \mathsf{DTIME}(n^c).
    \]
\end{df}


P: polynomial.



\begin{example}[Graph connectivity]
    Graph connectivity problem: 
    
    input: a graph $G$ and two vertices $s,t$, 
    
    inquiry: whether there is a path from $s$ to $t$.

    Using \textit{depth--first search} (DFS), 
    we can solve this problem in $O(|V|+|E|)$ steps.
\end{example}
